# GlobeTrotte Contributor License Agreement

The document below clarifies the terms under which You (the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner), may make "The Contributions" (software, bug fixes, configuration changes, documentation, or any other materials) to "The Work" (GlobeTrotte). This license protects You, "The Owner" ([Bin Hong Lee](https://github.com/binhonglee)) and licensees; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.   
Please read and confirm the following information about You and The Contributions. If you have questions about these terms, please contact me at binhong@binhong.me.

You and "The Owner" (Bin Hong Lee) agree:

* You grant to "The Owner" (Bin Hong Lee) a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, relicenseable, transferable license under all of Your relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, and any other rights) for any purpose, including: to use, copy, make available to the public, prepare derivative works of, distribute and publicly perform. It also includes the right to license the Contributions to others without any restriction on the nature of the sub-licence, including without limitation: (a) open source licenses like the MIT license; and (b) binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses. Except for the license You have granted to us in this agreement, You reserve all other rights You possess in the Contribution.

* You grant to "The Owner" (Bin Hong Lee) a non-exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated in this section), worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, transferable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer "The Work" (GlobeTrotte), where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with "The Work" (GlobeTrotte) to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or "The Work" (GlobeTrotte) to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

* You are able to grant me these rights. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license(s). If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make "The Contributions" on behalf of that employer, or that Your employer has waived such rights for "The Contributions".

* "The Contributions" are your original work. You represent that "The Contributions" are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or patent related to "The Contributions". You also represent that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license. For example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual property rights in "The Contributions" to an employer or customer, that would conflict with the terms of this license.

* I as "The Owner" (Bin Hong Lee) determine the code that is in "The Work" (GlobeTrotte). You understand that the decision to include "The Contribution(s)" in any project or source repository is entirely that of "The Owner" (Bin Hong Lee), and this agreement does not guarantee that "The Contributions" will be included in any product.

* No Implied Warranties. "The Owner" (Bin Hong Lee) acknowledges that, except as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
